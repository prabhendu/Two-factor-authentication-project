Two-Factor Authentication System for Web Applications:
------------------------------------------------------

Main Components:
-----------------

	1) Client-Side:

		- NewLogin.html :
		  Test Login page created with a simple HTML form.
		  Main part is the javscript writtem to capture keystroke,
		  calculate latency, compute canvas fingerprint, generate
		  hash of it, create a JSON object and send it to the REST
		  service implemented.

	2) Server-Side:

		- run.sh :                : wrapper to run the service.
		- Application.java        : Main class which involes the SPRING service.
		- InputModel.java         : Class to represent the request JSON object.
		- Greeting.java           : Class to represent the response JSON object.
		- GreetingController.java : Controller to map the service from url to class.
		- SimpleCORSFilter.java   : Class to allow cross-origin requests.
		- SecLogin.java           : Class which implements the algorithm.


How to run the service:
-----------------------
- Execute ./run.sh to start the service.
- Access the client login page using http://address:port/NewLogin.html (address:port correspond to server).
  In case our login page is not used, javascript can be included in any page to be used as login.
